# Mathematics for Decisions â€“ 7th Lecture

In this folder you'll fine ***three PDF files*** and **two folders**.

Files:

***1c\_Introduction\_AMPL\_GMPL.pdf***

We see what AMPL is and how it can be used to solve optimization problems. We also present GMPL, an open-source solver that offers the same main features of AMPL. We directly start with a very famous problem of Operations Research: the Diet Problem.

***1d\_AMPL\_Commands.pdf***

Just a list of the most useful commands of AMPL.

***WS-1b\_COVID\_Office\_Planning.pdf***

The COVID-19 emergency has forced us, among other things, to reorganize ourselves and... our office too!
In fact, even if theoretically there are twenty PhD students and postdocs assigned to Office 2.22, now the maximum number of allowed people is 6.
But this is not frightening: we are optimizers! For sure we can find a way to model this problem (as well as several variants) to find the best solution.
Why don't you help us? ;)

Folders:

***ampl-diet***

Implementation of the Diet problem (.mod and .dat files) with AMPL.

**ampl-swimming** 

Implementation of the Swimmint Team problem (.mod and .dat files), described in the previous **WS-1a\_Modelling\_Exercises.pdf**, with AMPL.

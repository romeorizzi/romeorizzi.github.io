# Mathematics for Decisions â€“ 1st Lecture 

Welcome again!

In this first folder you'll find ***one PDF file***.

***0\_Introduction.pdf***

What is "_modelling_"? When and why we do it? And what is "_Mathematical Programming_"?
In the slides you'll find the answers to these questions and what will be the main contents of the course.
Then we set our goals: _design_ mathematical models; _experiment_ computational and informatics skills; _find opportunities_ to get in touch with working and/or research environments; _connecting_ with professionals and disciplines for motivation.

# Mathematics for Decisions â€“ 21th Lecture

In this folder you'll find one file and two folders:

***3d\_IntegerLinearProgramming-GurobiExercises.pdf***

***gurobi-diet***

***gurobi-tsp***

We see how to use Gurobi both through a terminal window or by exploiting Gurobi APIs towards a specific programming language. In our case, we use Python.

We show how to formulate a Linear Programming problem in a Python script by importing the gurobipy module. As a first example, we solve (again) the Diet problem.
Then, we introduce *callbacks* and *lazy constraints*, an advanced feature of Gurobi which allows us to implement a Branch-and-Cut to solve the TSP.

# Mathematics for Decisions â€“ 20th Lecture

In this folder you'll find three files:

***3a\_IntegerLinearProgramming-TSP-BC.pdf***

***Daresta2018-PerfectMatching.pdf***

***3c\_IntegerLinearProgramming-Gurobi.pdf***

Starting from Branch-and-Bound, today we see the Branch-and-Cut and its application to the TSP.
Then, we discuss a few other Integer Linear Programming problems and their formulations. You can go deepen with the Perfect Matching by having a look to the project done by some of your colleagues in 2018.

In the last file, you'll find the instructions to download and install Gurobi, which we will see in the next lecture.

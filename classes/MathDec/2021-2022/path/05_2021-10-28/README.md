# Mathematics for Decisions â€“ 5th Lecture

Let's continue with the ___modelling___ part of this course. In this folder you'll find ***two PDF files***.

***1a\_Basics\_Linear\_Programming.pdf***

If you have already attended an Operations Research class, you should know what we are talking about. Anyway, it's always good to recall the needed preliminaries for the rest of the course. Otherwise, if it's the first time you encounter these topics, these slides are particularly addressed to you. Don't be afraid and let us know, so we can support and help you acquire these skills. We define what a linear programming problem is, composed of variables, constraints, and an objective function, and you'll discover the difference among LP, ILP, and MILP. Then, we introduce the Simplex method and the theory of duality. Finally, we conclude with a very quick mention to sensitivity analysis.


***WS-1a\_Modelling\_Exercises.pdf***

Let's begin our worksheets series by reasoning about some problems inspired by real-life situations, trying to formulate, model, or solve them already.

***3a\_IntegerLinearProgramming\_TSP.pdf***

Introduction to Integer Linear Programming and one of the most famous and studied problems in combinatorial optimization and theoretical computer science: the Traveling Salesman Problem.

We investigate this problem in order to show some limits in using AMPL and also to introduce an exact method called Branch-and-Bound.

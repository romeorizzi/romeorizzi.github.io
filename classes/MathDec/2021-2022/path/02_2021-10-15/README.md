***1b\_How\_To\_Install\_AMPL.pdf***

We told you this is gonna be a practical course, and this is how we start: modelling problems with LP, ILP and MILP, using AMPL (*Algebraic Modelling Programming Language*). These slides explain how you can download and install the needed tools on your laptop. Since some of next lectures will be full of AMPL exercises, we strongly recommend you to do it. It's very important that you will be able to work on your machine. If you have any issues installing the software, contact us.
